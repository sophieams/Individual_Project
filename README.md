# Sensitivity Analysis of a Complex Dynamical System of Suicide
## Sophie Engels Individual Project - MSc Computational Science

This project explores the sensitivity of a complex dynamical systems model of Suicide by Wang et. al (2023).<br>
The original paper with the model description can be found here: https://psyarxiv.com/b29cs/.<br> 
The original code for the model developed by Wang et. al can be found here: https://github.com/ShirleyBWang/math_model_suicide.

To generate new model output data, use the files sample_daily.py or sample_overall.py. All plot files can be used to analyze said data. Original model output data was too large to upload to the Github repository. 

Folders:<br>
daily_data - Contains precomputed sensitivity indices for every day of the simulation.<br>
figures - Contains all figures used in the individual project report.<br>
overall_data - contains precomputed senstivity indices for the maximum of the specified model output.<br>
